        <h2><strong>My Special Lady</strong></h2>
        <div>
            <p>I'm writing this poem for a very <em><strong>special</strong></em> lady,<br> Always and forever, She'll always be my baby.<br> In good times and bad, I won't love her any less</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The way I feel about her, Words can't express,<br> She's so <em><strong>beautiful</strong>,
        </em>She knocks me off my feet.<br> If loving her is wrong, then I don't want to be right</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I am dreaming of holding her, in my arms so tight,<br> This absolutely special lady means so much to me,<br> She goes by the most beautiful name, <em><strong>Harira</strong></em>.</p>
